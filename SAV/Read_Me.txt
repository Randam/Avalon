Avalon Code Editor

Installation
____________________________________________________________
Unzip ACEex.exe to your \Avalon\sav direcotry.
If you have already unzipped to the default directory, this file will reside in
C:\Avalon\sav.
If this is not the correct path for you Avalon savegamX.sav files then
you may move the ACE.exe file to the correct directory and delete any
erroneous directories.

Using Avalon Code Editor
____________________________________________________________
Start ACE and then start Avalon. You can ALT-TAB to ACE at any point in
the game (better pause it first) and ALT-TAB back after making changes.
The program will automatically always load 'Savegam1.sav' by default upon
startup. You can select any of the Saved games in the File Name Combo box.
Any changes you make in ACE will be written to the currently selected saved
game file when you click the 'Save Info' button.
Now when you reload the saved game, any information you changed will take
effect. Because of the nature of Avalon, unfortunately, all enemies will always
reappear on the screen when the new game is loaded. As an added bonus,
however, every time you click the 'Save Info' button your Mace Life will be
fully restored. :)

NOTE-
Be sure to press the 'Reset' button to refresh file data after saving a game in
Avalon so that new progress is not overwritten.
