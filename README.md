# Avalon
Avalon DOS RPG was a game I worked on for two years, from 1996 to 1998. It is fully finished and playable. Avalon has seen well over 200k downloads from various freeware and shareware websites. In 2000 it won the ZDNet Shareware Award as best strategy game.

## Why did I put this on GitHub?
From the start, I have made the entire sourcecode available. So why not put it on the largest repository of free sourcecode in the world? I can think of a few reasons actually:
1. This code is very old. 
2. It was written in Turbo Pascal, a dead procedural language for real mode DOS. 
3. The game is not even playable anymore on a PC nowadays without running Doxbox.
4. I was 16 when I wrote most of it (hence the many spelling mistakes).

That's why it took so long. But in the end, I decided to put it here after all. Why?
1. I'm still proud of it, because it is fun to play, fully finished and has almost no bugs.
2. It's funny to see ancient Pascal sourcecode.
3. It's funny to see MY ancient Pascal sourcecode.
4. It has its own game engine, based on layered tiles with some subtle animations in it as well

## What's in the box

/PAS - The Pascal sourcecode
/PCX - The images and spritesheets
/DAT - Text files from the characters in the game
/SAV - Save files (and a third party save file editor called ACE)
/Sfont - Soundfonts that sound nice with the game
/TPU - Turbo Pascal compiled Unit files
/VOC - Sounds

From Dosbox:
- AVALON.EXE - start this to run the game 
- ENDDEMO.EXE MIGCODE - run this to see the enddemo 
- FLDEDIT.EXE - start the map editor

## What's funny

procedure StringFellowHawk (charnr : Byte); # A function named after the main Airwolf character.
