1. About Avalon

	Avalon is an RPG game with Wavetable MIDI music and mode-x graphics.


2. How to install

	To install Avalon, just copy all the files to your harddrive and start AVALON.EXE to play!
	If the music doesn't work, you can change the settings of the General Midi Port in 
	GMPORT.CFG. (The default is 330)
	Unfortunately I've lost the sources of my SOUND unit, so you won't be able to change
	those settings, which are configured at:
		Port:	220h
		IRQ:	5
		DMA:	1
	Which are the default settings for soundblaster cards.


3. How to play

	Just run C:\AVALON\AVALON.EXE to start the game.
